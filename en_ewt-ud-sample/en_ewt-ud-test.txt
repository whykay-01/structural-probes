If they continue to add features so they can justify their likely sky - high valuation , Google risks losing a huge chunk of their customer base to the next keep - it - simple search engine .
Remember when a whole lot of people had to die because a Swedish newspaper printed those cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed ?
Now Iran wants to turn the tables and is inviting cartoonists to do their best by depicting the Holocaust .
Amazingly , these idiots think a cartoon of Mohammed is comparable to what we can expect in this new fun contest :
TEHRAN ( AFP ) -
An international contest of cartoons on the Holocaust opened in Tehran in response to the publication in Western papers last September of caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed .
" We staged this fair to explore the limits of freedom Westerners believe in , " Masoud Shojai , head of the country 's " Iran Cartoon " association and the fair organizer , said .
" They can freely write anything they like about our prophet , but if one raises doubts about the Holocaust he is either fined or sent to prison , " he added .
" Though we do not deny that fact that Jews were killed in the ( second world ) war , why should the Palestinians pay for it ? "
Shojai told the opening ceremony of the month - long fair in Tehran 's Palestine Contemporary Art Museum .
He added that around 1,100 cartoons were submitted by participants from more than 60 countries and that more than 200 are on show .
He said the top three cartoons will be announced on September 2 , with the winners being awarded prizes of 12,000 , 8,000 and 5,000 dollars respectively .
This cute little stunt is only going to prove just how fanatic the extremist Muslims are .
When they saw a cartoon of their prophet , people had to die .
When their precious cartoons are released I highly doubt it will look like the end of the world .
US Marines moved into most of Fallujah on Wednesday , though they were still meeting pockets of resistance .
The Fallujah fighting has killed fair numbers of Iraqi noncombatants , including Shaikh Abdul Wahhab al - Janabi of the respected Association of Muslim Scholars .
Armed clashes broke out in several northern Iraqi cities on Wednesday , leaving some 22 persons dead in Mosul , Baiji , and Tuz .
Hundreds of persons mounted demonstrations against the Fallujah campaign in Tikrit and Huwaijah , as well , according to az - Zaman .
The battles and demonstrations were provoked by the US assault on Fallujah .
Guerrillas threatened to assassinate Prime Minister Iyad Allawi and Minister of Defense Hazem Shaalan in retaliation for the attack .
Allawi 's aged cousin and the man 's wife and daughter - in - law were abducted and guerrillas threaten to behead them if the Fallujah compaign is not stopped .
In Iraqi society , PM Allawi is responsible for protecting his clan , including especially his first cousins , so this kidnapping makes him look weak and brings substantial shame on him .
The US Marines took most of Fallujah Wednesday , but still face pockets of resistance .
If Samarra and other cities are any guide , those pockets of resistance could go on bedeviling the US for some time to come .
The intrepid Ed Wong of the NYT has more on the Sunni boycott of the elections .
He reports that the Iraqi Islamic Party , which had earlier been absolutely committed to getting out the Sunni vote , is now wavering and saying their position will depend on the situation .
The outbreak of demonstrations and violence throughout the Sunni Arab regions on Wednesday did not bode well for Sunni participation in the January elections .
Jim Lobe has more on the political implications of the Fallujah assault , both in Iraq and in Washington .

[ Am at a conference and ca n't blog much right now but will try to catch up the next couple of days . ]
The hottest item on Christmas wish lists this year is nuclear weapons .
Al - Qaeda wants them , Iran wants them , Russia wants the better ones , and all the US wants is to give them all a piece of coal .
For the last few years there have been tensions with Iran ’s nuclear program with word coming this week that a deal was reached through the European Union that meets with the approval of the International Atomic Energy Agency .
At the same time , an Iranian Opposition Group released what they call proof of a covert nuclear weapons program .
Arial photos , loose connections to AQ Kahn and Libya make up the evidence that the group presented .
Russia also announced that it was seeking and building the best nukes the world ’s ever seen .
President Vladimir Putin said Russia is will have new nuclear weapons that other countries do not and will not have .
With the demand so high , the question arises on to who should be or has the right to be the Santa of nuclear weapons .
Right now that seems to be the US , EU , and IAEA .
But not always do those three agree , and not always are their decisions equal .
The US has strongly opposed a nuclear weapons program of Iran , yet Israel , which to this day has never officially said that they posses nuclear weapons , ranks around fifth in nuclear strength .
It is estimated that Israel has over 200 nuclear weapons yet neither the US nor any of her allies expresses the slightest concern .
North Korea ’s Kim Jong Ill also has the bomb at the top of his list and Santa seems to have already come a few years ago .
It is rumored that North Korea has at least a couple nuclear weapons .
But getting past who should get them , is who has them , and who is really close .
The case against Iran has a feeling of Déjà vu .
Arial photos of the lab were uranium is being enriched , somewhat like those of chemical weapons stockpiles in Iraq .
America cried wolf in Iraq , and what ’s scary is that sooner or later , that wolf will probably get us .
